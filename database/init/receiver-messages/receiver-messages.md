# Receiver Events

In the hallowed chronicles of this digital domain, the receiver messages collection stands as the venerable tome, where records of all heralded activities are meticulously scribed. This tome is of paramount importance, for within its pages lie the declarations that the diligent watchers—known as receiver processes—survey with unwavering vigilance. Upon the scribing of a new entry, when a signal message casts its influence upon the realm, the receiver processes awaken, their purpose singular and clear: to act in accordance with the edicts prescribed by their corresponding signal.

Each leaf in this tome bears the indelible mark of the signal that brought it into being, the ObjectId of the schema etched into its essence, binding the message to its origin. The payload, a cargo of critical import, is carried forth in these entries, alongside the kindred attributes shared with the signal message: status, version, and the immutable timestamps that anchor them in history—their creation and their last moment of transformation.
