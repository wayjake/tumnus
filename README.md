# tumnus

Mr. Tumnus acts as a bridge between the human world and Narnia, introducing the Pevensie children to the land's wonders and perils. His character illustrates the moral dilemmas faced by many characters in the series; caught between fear of the Witch's tyranny and the desire to do what is right.

Mr. Tumnus is a deeply sympathetic character whose personal journey from fear to bravery mirrors the overarching themes of courage and redemption in "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe." His friendship with Lucy is both touching and pivotal to the narrative.
